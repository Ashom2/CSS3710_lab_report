# Generative model for Alzheimer's Disease brain scans using styleGAN
The purpose of this model is to generate believable fake 2d MRI scans of the brains of Alzheimer's patients.
StyleGAN is a variation of a generative adversarial network (GAN) - which works by pitching competing "generator" and "discriminator" networks against one another. The main difference of styleGAN is how it uses progressive growing to train the generator network stably by increasing the resolution gradually during training (8x8, 16x16, 32x32, ect). This model uses a preprocessed version of the ADNI dataset for Alzheimer's disease. This model could be used for training medical professionals to recognise both healthy and unhealthy brains.
